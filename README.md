# 🗄️ HackerRank SQL Problem Solving

Welcome to my **HackerRank SQL Problem Solving** repository!

This repository contains my SQL problem solving approach and solutions to HackerRank challenges, systematically categorized by difficulty level:

- **Easy**
  - **Basic**
  - **Intermediate**
  - **Advanced**
- **Medium**
  - **Basic**
  - **Intermediate**
  - **Advanced**
- **Hard**
  - **Intermediate**
  - **Advanced**

Each problem has its own dedicated SQL file, which includes:

- **Problem Explanation** – A brief overview of the problem statement.
- **Solution Intuition** – The thought process and reasoning behind the approach taken.
- **SQL Query** – A well-structured solution to the problem.
- **Alternative Solutions** (if applicable) – Some problems feature multiple solutions for optimization or to explore different approaches.

## Why This Repository?

This collection serves as a structured reference for:

- Learning **SQL techniques** through real-world problems.
- Understanding different ways to solve SQL queries efficiently.
- Exploring **query optimizations** and alternative methods for better performance.
- Gaining insights into **SQL patterns** commonly used in technical interviews.
